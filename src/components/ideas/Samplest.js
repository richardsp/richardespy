There should also be a search function so the user can find a song by title or artist. The playlist should include the song title and all of the samples. If the search isnâ€™t too recursive, any other song that sampled the original should be selectable to add to the playlist. The focus should be on iTunes APIs, although Spotify would work if it's easier.`,
