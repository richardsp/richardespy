  ingredients: [
    "1 cup (226g) unsalted brown butter",
    "1 1/2 cups (300g) light brown sugar, packed",
    "1/2 cup (100g) toasted granulated sugar",
    "1 large egg, plus 1 egg yolk (room temperature preferred)",
    "2 teaspoons vanilla extract",
    "1/4 cup (60ml) maple syrup",
    "3 1/4 cups (415g) all-purpose flour",
    "2 teaspoons cornstarch",
    "1 teaspoon baking powder",
    "1 teaspoon baking soda",
    "1 teaspoon salt",
    "2 cups chocolate chunks",
    "1 cup chopped pecans"
  ],
  instructions: [
    "Toast Sugar: Spread granulated sugar on a baking sheet and toast it at 350째F (180째C) for about 10 minutes until it starts to caramelize lightly. Set aside to cool.",
    "Brown the Butter: In a saucepan, melt the unsalted butter over medium heat. Continue to cook, stirring frequently, until it turns a golden brown and develops a nutty aroma. Set aside to cool slightly.",
    "Mix Wet Ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, combine the browned butter, toasted sugar, and light brown sugar. Stir until well mixed. Add the egg and egg yolk one at a time, stirring until combined. Stir in the vanilla extract and maple syrup.",
    "Prepare Dry Ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Gradually mix the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until just combined.",
    "Add Mix-ins: Stir in the chocolate chunks and chopped pecans until evenly distributed throughout the dough.",
    "Chill Dough: Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate the cookie dough overnight for best results.",
    "Preheat Oven: When ready to bake, preheat your oven to 350째F (180째C) and line cookie sheets with parchment paper.",
    "Form Cookies: Scoop cookie dough into balls and place them on the prepared cookie sheet, spacing them at least 2 inches apart.",
    "Bake: Bake for about 14 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown but the center still looks slightly underdone.",
    "Cool: Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.",
    "Tip: Keep unbaked cookie dough in the fridge while waiting to bake the next batch. Do not place dough on a hot cookie sheet."
